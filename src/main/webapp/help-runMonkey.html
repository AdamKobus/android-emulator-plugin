Runs the Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/monkey.html">Application
Exerciser Monkey</a> tool on an Android emulator or device.
<p>
The results will be written to a file "<tt>monkey.txt</tt>" in the root of the workspace.<br>
Selecting the &quot;Publish Android monkey tester results&quot; option below will examine this file
at the end of the build and will publish a summary on the build page.
</p>
<p>
If an Android emulator was started automatically via the "Run an Android emulator
during build" option above, <tt>monkey</tt> will be run on that device.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the tool will be run on an emulator or USB-attached Android device.<br/>
If more than one emulator or device is present, this step will currently hang until
only one emulator or device is available &mdash; this is the default Android SDK behaviour.
