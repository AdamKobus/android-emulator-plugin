- SDK installation should be on by default; option name and help file need to be updated
- ABI support appeared in r13, i.e. using --abi with "android create avd"
- Need to fix getSdkRootFromPath/isSdkToolsDirectory as they're trying to do an impossible check: that both adb and emulator are in the same directory... to test this, install an SDK without platform-tools and watch the misdetection occur...
- Need to combine discoverAndroidHome and getAndroidSdk
- Grab Semaphore when calling adb so that, after we know we've auto-installed some components, we can manually restart adb after all Semaphores have been released -- though this depends on Android bug 21923
- Tools r16 will probably make "android.bat" become "android.exe" which will cause issues in our Tool class
- Add timeouts to all ADB actions, including "logcat -c" etc.
- Rewrite/split-up wiki page into more parts
- Update/add screenshots to wiki
>> STDERR (or whatever we do) isn't caught on Windows, but is on Linux...
